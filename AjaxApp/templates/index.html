                <h3>ABOUT SNAKES</h3>
                <p>There are more than 3,000 species of snakes on the planet and they’re found everywhere except in
                    Antarctica, Iceland, Ireland, Greenland, and New Zealand. About 600 species are venomous, and only
                    about 200—seven percent—are able to kill or significantly wound a human.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nonvenomous snakes, which range from harmless garter snakes to the not-so-harmless python, dispatch
                    their victims by swallowing them alive or constricting them to death. Whether they kill by striking
                    with venom or squeezing, nearly all snakes eat their food whole, in sometimes astoundingly large
                    portions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Almost all snakes are covered in scales and as reptiles, they’re cold blooded and must regulate
                    their body temperature externally. Scales serve several purposes: They trap moisture in arid
                    climates and
                    reduce friction as the snake moves. There have been several species of snakes discovered that are
                    mostly
                    scaleless, but even those have scales on their bellies.
                </p>
                <h3>HOW SNAKES HUNT</h3>
                <p>
                    Snakes also have forked tongues, which they flick in different directions to smell their
                    surroundings.
                    That lets them know when danger—or food—is nearby.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Snakes have several other ways to detect a snack. Openings called pit holes in front of their eyes
                    sense
                    the heat given off by warm-blooded prey. And bones in their lower jaws pick up vibrations from
                    rodents
                    and other scurrying animals. When they do capture prey, snakes can eat animals up to three times
                    bigger
                    than their head is wide because their lower jaws unhinge from their upper jaws. Once in a snake’s
                    mouth,
                    the prey is held in place by teeth that face inward, trapping it there.
                </p>
                <h3>HABITS</h3>
                <p>
                    About once a month snakes shed their skin, a process called ecdysis that makes room for growth and
                    gets
                    rid of parasites. They rub against a tree branch or other object, then slither out of their skin
                    head
                    first, leaving it discarded inside-out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most snakes lay eggs, but some species—like sea snakes—give live birth to young. Very few snakes pay
                    any
                    attention to their eggs, with the exception of pythons, which incubate their eggs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are roughly a hundred snake species listed by the IUCN Red List as endangered, typically due
                    to
                    habitat loss from development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here’s a fact to make ophidiophobes feel uneasy: Five species of snakes can fly.
                </p>

                <h3>SEA SNAKES</h3>
                <p>
                    Most snakes live on land, but there are about 70 species of snakes that live in the Indian and
                    Pacific
                    oceans. Sea snakes and their cousins, kraits, are some of the most venomous snakes that exist, but
                    they
                    pose little threat to humans because they’re shy, gentle, and their fangs are too short to do much
                    damage.
                </p>
                <h3>SNAKES AND MAN</h3>
                <p>
                    Snakes are misunderstood and often maligned, primarily out of ignorance about their true nature and
                    position in the natural world. All snakes are predators, but venomous snakes (that is, biting snakes
                    that use their fangs to inject toxins into their victims) have given an inaccurate reputation to the
                    entire group, as most people cannot tell the dangerous from the harmless. Only a small percentage
                    (fewer
                    than 300 species) are venomous, and of those only about half are capable of inflicting a lethal
                    bite.
                    Although snakebite mortality worldwide is estimated at 30,000–40,000 people per year, the majority
                    of
                    deaths (25,000–35,000) occur in Southeast Asia, principally because of poor medical treatment,
                    malnutrition of victims, and a large number of venomous species. Although there are 8,000 venomous
                    snakebites per year in the United States, the average number of annual fatalities is only a dozen or
                    so
                    per year—fewer than are attributed to bee stings and lightning strikes. In Mexico, 10 times as many
                    people die annually from bee stings as from snakebites.
